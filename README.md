Printf()
 ------------------------

The printf project is a collaboration between Yahaya Abdulwasiu and Elisha Kuje, students of **ALX Africa/Holberton School.** 
- The Project was aimed at creating a function named `"_printf"` which imitates the actual `printf` command located in the `stdio.h` library.
- It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of `"printf"`.
_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print to standard output. Its prototype is the following:
`int _printf(const char *format, ...)`
